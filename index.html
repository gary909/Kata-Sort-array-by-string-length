    <p>
        Write a function that takes an array of strings as an argument and returns a sorted array containing the same strings, <br>
        ordered from shortest to longest.<br>
<br>
        For example, if this array were passed as an argument:<br>
<br>
        ["Telescopes", "Glasses", "Eyes", "Monocles"]<br>
<br>
        Your function would return the following array:<br>
<br>
        ["Eyes", "Glasses", "Monocles", "Telescopes"]<br>
<br>
        All of the strings in the array passed to your function will be different lengths, so you will not have to decide how <br>
        to order multiple strings of the same length.<br>
